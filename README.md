# MakeCode-Android

This project is completely inspired by [Microsoft Build 2020 Student Zone](https://github.com/microsoft/StudentsAtBuild). From the 
wonderful talks presented at  [Microsoft Build 2020 Student Zone](https://github.com/microsoft/StudentsAtBuild) about [Microsoft MakeCode 
Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/), I noticed that there was no native suppport or any such tool to convert or un the games made in
MakeCode in Android or IoS. This project shows how you could run your MakeCode project on Android (IoS support coming soon!). The project 
is completely **beginner friendly** which means even if you don't know about Android, you can still get the project up and running 
(Detailed instructions meantioned below)

## What to expect

This project shows you how you could set up an Android project with a good UI, in very little time. You should expect to be able to run 
your MakeCode example in this manner-
